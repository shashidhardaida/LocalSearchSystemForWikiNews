# LocalSearchSystemForWikiNews
As a data engineer it may be worth learning web development from organizations perspective. One of the things that are useful in data engineering are backoffices. 
Little portals where you can control and assess the data pipelines. Web development can help here. In the right team with the right problems to solve it can be a massive skill.

Having said that I have developed a web application using python Django as my academic project. The main objective of this project is creating a system that can scrap/extract the data from wikinews and
store it in a local database. The system/application provides an interafce for user management (Sign up, account management), Item management (Making changes in the news data and update in database),
Searching the news items (An interface like google serach page).

In this project I learned about how to design and develop an aplication that can handle extracting, transforming and storing the data in a database. The technolgies involved in this project are Python, Django Framework, Html, CSS, Javascript, Ealstic Search and web scrapping
